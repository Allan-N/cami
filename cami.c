			 * So originally, I had it try to acquire ami_read_lock here and then assert that current_response was NULL.
			 * This intuitively makes some sense as we know that the consumer should release the lock once we write to
			 * the pipe, and it will then set current_response to NULL and then release the lock. Then we'll be able
			 * to acquire it and then assert it is actually NULL.
			 *
			 * The problem with this was the occasional race condition. On occasion (and depending on many factors like
			 * how many debug statements are logged and other expensive operations), the thread could release the lock
			 * and then immediately reacquire it as it tries to send another Action before we've had a chance to acquire
			 * the lock. Basically, if for whatever reason, we're not first in line to acquire the lock after we write
			 * to the pipe, then we can have a problem.
			 *
			 * This occurs whenever that thread releases the lock but it gets reacquired before we acquire it.
			 *
			 * You can easily reproduce this, in fact, by putting making the usleep below run. It took a little bit
			 * to figure out exactly what was going on, but once you know what's going on, you can force it to happen.
			 *
			 * The fact is that we don't actually NEED to acquire ami_read_lock. However, if we're not able to acquire
			 * it, then we can't actually verify that current_response SHOULD, in fact, be NULL.
			 * So, we'll trylock instead of lock. Most of the time, we SHOULD be able to acquire the lock, because
			 * it's immediately after the write call. If for some reason we get unscheduled right here and we can't
			 * acquire the lock, then just keep going. Otherwise, what'll happen is we'll block until that lock gets
			 * released. This is a HUGE problem, because the thread that is holding the lock is waiting for us to send
			 * it the response to the action it requested, which we can't do until we acquire and release the lock,
			 * so we can get the response from Asterisk and pass it on.
			 *
			 * TL;DR: Essentially, this would create a deadlock, and if it we didn't have action sending threads time
			 * out after so many milliseconds (suppose, as might be reasonable, we had them wait forever), it would
			 * in fact be an actual legit deadlock and that would be very, very bad!
			 *
			 * On the other hand, if WE acquire the lock first (as we should be able to 99% of the time), we can
			 * check that the world hasn't fallen apart, and then release it immediately. It's only when somebody
			 * else acquires it first, due to a scheduling anomaly, that deadlock would ensue if we tried to
			 * unconditionally acquire the lock.
			 *
			 * UPDATE: Actually, this scheduling phenomenon can be more frequent than I initially assumed.
			 * It can so happen that other threads have a very decent shot at acquiring this lock before we can.
			 * So if we can't acquire the lock, don't panic even then, it's not a problem either way. That said,
			 * if we are able to acquire it at some point, we will. Consumers should neither know nor care about this.

	 * the old value when done.
	 * This is safe to do, since we may have a longer wait time for actions that arrive during this time, which is okay.
	 * If we get another reload while we're in one, we won't override it to avoid doing so twice, to ensure
	 * we always properly restore the original value.
	 *
	 * This is not merely done to avoid annoying logs... since we bail out if we don't receive a response in the threshold,
	 * we'll:
	 * a) Fail to return a response to the reload, which effectively returns an error for a reload that may have succeeded.
	 * b) Not fetch the response, which means when it does finish and arrive, somebody else will see it, which is not
	 *    what we wanted either.
	 *
	 * So we need to always remember to override maxwaitms to the maximum reasonable value for events that may
	 * take longer than normal, such as Reload.
